# Welcome to my RDP!
- Hey, Thanks for visiting my Github project! I made a Windows Server 2019 RDP. It's very simple to activate!
- Step 1: Press "Fork" so that you have elevated permissions. Then simply click "Settings".
- Step 2: Click on "Secrets" and for the name put NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN, Then put for the value your Ngrok auth token.
- Step 3: Your most likely wondering what a Ngrok Authtoken is. Well, Github needs a source so that it can be secure. Anyway, Just sign up for an account then copy
the token. It should look like random letters and numbers. Just paste that into your value section.
- Step 4: Now that you have your secret added, You can run the workflow. Just sumply click "Actions", Then go to "NoahRDP" Then click Run Workflow. Your all set,
The installation is pretty fast. And the RDP is active for 6 gours. You can run the workflow again after the 6 hours.
